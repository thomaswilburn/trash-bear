🦝 Trash Bear 🦝
===================

I often want to open up something in a container tab that will only last for a single link. Firefox's `Multi Account Containers <https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers>`_ extension is fantastic for sites that I visit repeatedly, or managing consistent identities. But sometimes I just want to open something as a fresh profile (*not* a private browser, which can be detected) and then throw it away as soon as I'm done reading.

Trash Bear gives you that, quickly and easily. Right-click a link, choose "open in new trash container," and then read to your heart's content. The container will be automatically deleted as soon as Trash Bear detects that it's not being used anymore. Truly, it's a circle of life.
